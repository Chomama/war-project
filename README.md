WAR-LW

This project is a lightweight version of the card game war.
The app exposes two endpoints "/start" and "/score".
The "/start" endpoint utilizes the node functionility execFile() to launch a background process that runs the logic
the card game in javascript file play_war.
The game simulates two players and once the game ends, writes to a json file to keep track of lifetime wins for each player.
The "/score" endpoint utilizes node module fs to read from the json and return the scores.

Basic testing is done using Mocha and Chai and can be found in the tests directory.
